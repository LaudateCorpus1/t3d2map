# t3d2map

## What's this?

This is a project I started developing a while back that converts 
an Unreal [T3D document](https://wiki.beyondunreal.com/Legacy:T3D_File) to Quake's MAP format.

Please keep in mind that it's currently unfinished.

It currently only supports T3D documents generated by older versions of UnrealEd (e.g. 1/2).

## Status

There are a number of missing features and I haven't touched this in a while. Again, it's
not finished.

It will convert all geometry and a number of actors, however much of the geometry
won't be exported in a way you might expect due to the lack of rotation. It's also
not as flexible as I would've liked.

If I suddenly find some time I hope to return to this again, but we'll see.
